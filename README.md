# Microsoft Python Driver for SQL Server
 
**mssql-python** is a Python driver for Microsoft SQL Server and the Azure SQL family of databases. It leverages Direct Database Connectivity (DDBC) that enables direct connections to SQL Server without requiring an external driver manager. Designed to comply with the [DB API 2.0](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/) specification, this driver also introduces Pythonic enhancements for improved usability and functionality. It supports a full range of database operations, including connection management, query execution, and transaction handling.
 
The driver is compatible with all the Python versions >= 3.10

## Installation
 
**Windows:** mssql-python can be installed with [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)
```bash
pip install mssql-python
```
**MacOS:** mssql-python can be installed with [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)
```bash
# For Mac, OpenSSL is a pre-requisite - skip if already present
brew install openssl
pip install mssql-python
```
**Linux:** mssql-python can be installed with [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)
```bash
# For Alpine
apk add libtool krb5-libs krb5-dev

# For Debian/Ubuntu  
apt-get install -y libltdl7 libkrb5-3 libgssapi-krb5-2

# For RHEL
dnf install -y libtool-ltdl krb5-libs

# For SUSE
zypper install -y libltdl7 libkrb5-3 libgssapi-krb5-2

# For SUSE/openSUSE
zypper install -y libltdl7

pip install mssql-python
```

## Key Features
### Supported Platforms
 
Windows, MacOS and Linux (manylinux - Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, SUSE (x64 only) & musllinux - Alpine)

> **Note:**
> SUSE Linux ARM64 is not supported by Microsoft ODBC Driver. Use x64 architecture for SUSE deployments.
 
### DBAPI v2.0 Compliance
 
The Microsoft **mssql-python** module is designed to be fully compliant with the DB API 2.0 specification. This ensures that the driver adheres to a standardized interface for database access in Python, providing consistency and reliability across different database systems. Key aspects of DBAPI v2.0 compliance include:
 
- **Connection Objects**: Establishing and managing connections to the database.
- **Cursor Objects**: Executing SQL commands and retrieving results.
- **Transaction Management**: Supporting commit and rollback operations to ensure data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: Providing a consistent set of exceptions for handling database errors.
- **Parameter Substitution**: Allowing the use of placeholders in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
 
By adhering to the DB API 2.0 specification, the mssql-python module ensures compatibility with a wide range of Python applications and frameworks, making it a versatile choice for developers working with Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Managed Instance.
 
### Support for Microsoft Entra ID Authentication
 
The Microsoft mssql-python driver enables Python applications to connect to Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or Azure SQL Managed Instance using Microsoft Entra ID identities. It supports a variety of authentication methods, including username and password, Microsoft Entra managed identity (system-assigned and user-assigned), Integrated Windows Authentication in a federated, domain-joined environment, interactive authentication via browser, device code flow for environments without browser access, and the default authentication method based on environment and configuration. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most suitable authentication approach for their deployment scenario.

EntraID authentication is now fully supported on MacOS and Linux but with certain limitations as mentioned in the table:

| Authentication Method | Windows Support | macOS/Linux Support | Notes |
|----------------------|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| ActiveDirectoryPassword | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Username/password-based authentication |
| ActiveDirectoryInteractive | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Interactive login via browser; requires user interaction |
| ActiveDirectoryMSI (Managed Identity) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | For Azure VMs/containers with managed identity |
| ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Use client ID and secret or certificate |
| ActiveDirectoryIntegrated | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Only works on Windows (requires Kerberos/SSPI) |
| ActiveDirectoryDeviceCode | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Device code flow for authentication; suitable for environments without browser access |
| ActiveDirectoryDefault | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Uses default authentication method based on environment and configuration |

### Enhanced Pythonic Features
 
The driver offers a suite of Pythonic enhancements that streamline database interactions, making it easier for developers to execute queries, manage connections, and handle data more efficiently.
 
### Connection Pooling
 
The Microsoft mssql_python driver provides built-in support for connection pooling, which helps improve performance and scalability by reusing active database connections instead of creating a new connection for every request. This feature is enabled by default. For more information, refer [Connection Pooling Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-python/wiki/Connection#connection-pooling).
 
## Getting Started Examples
Connect to SQL Server and execute a simple query:
 
```python
import mssql_python
 
# Establish a connection
# Specify connection string
connection_string = "SERVER=<your_server_name>;DATABASE=<your_database_name>;UID=<your_user_name>;PWD=<your_password>;Encrypt=yes;"
connection = mssql_python.connect(connection_string)
 
# Execute a query
cursor = connection.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * from customer")
rows = cursor.fetchall()
 
for row in rows:
    print(row)
 
# Close the connection
connection.close()
 
```
